# SoulyCore: Developer Tooling (As-Is)

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Baseline (Current Implementation)

---

### 1. SoulyDev Center

The SoulyDev Center is an integrated, modal-based control panel designed specifically for developers working on the SoulyCore project. It serves as a centralized hub for managing, documenting, and debugging the application's features and behavior directly within the running application.

*   **Access:** It can be opened from the main sidebar navigation.
*   **Purpose:** To provide developers with tools that enhance productivity and provide deep insight into the application's inner workings without needing to leave the UI.
*   **Structure:** It uses a tabbed interface to switch between different tools, such as the Features Dictionary, a project dashboard, and documentation viewers.

### 2. Features Dictionary

The Features Dictionary is the cornerstone of the Dev Center. It is a live, interactive, and data-driven documentation system that serves as the single source of truth for the application's feature set.

*   **Functionality:** It provides a full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) interface for managing feature specifications.
*   **Data Model:** Each feature is an entry in the `features` table in the Vercel Postgres database and contains the following fields:
    *   **Name & Overview:** High-level description.
    *   **Status:** The current implementation state ('âœ… Completed', 'ðŸŸ¡ Needs Improvement', etc.).
    *   **UI/UX Breakdown:** A structured JSON field detailing sub-features and their individual statuses.
    *   **Logic & Data Flow:** A textual description of the technical implementation and data pathways.
    *   **Key Files:** A JSON array listing the critical source code files related to the feature.
    *   **Notes:** Free-form text for developer comments or future improvement ideas.
*   **API Backend:** All operations are handled by the RESTful endpoints located at `/api/features` and `/api/features/[featureId]`.
*   **Benefit:** This approach replaces static `README.md` files with a dynamic system, ensuring that feature documentation is always synchronized with the database and can be updated by the development team in real-time.

### 3. Log Output Panel

The Log Output Panel is a real-time debugging tool integrated into the main chat interface. It provides a chronological stream of logs generated by both the frontend and backend.

*   **Access:** It is a collapsible panel at the bottom of the `ChatWindow` and can be toggled via an icon in the sidebar toolbar or the header.
*   **Data Source:** Logs are persisted in the `logs` table in the Vercel Postgres database. The panel fetches this data from the `/api/logs/all` endpoint.
*   **Real-Time Logging:** Both client-side actions (via `useLog` hook) and server-side processes (via `serverLog` helper) can write new entries to the database through the `/api/logs/create` endpoint.
*   **Features:**
    *   **Filtering:** Users can filter the log view by severity level (`info`, `warn`, `error`).
    *   **Search:** A text input allows for full-text search across log messages and their JSON payloads.
    *   **Auto-Scroll:** A toggle to control whether the panel automatically scrolls to the newest log entry.
    *   **Clear Logs:** A button to truncate the entire `logs` table for a clean slate.
*   **Benefit:** This provides developers with an invaluable, persistent, and filterable view of application events, crucial for debugging complex, asynchronous workflows between the client and server.
