# The SoulyCore Cognitive Model

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Proposal

### 1. Introduction

This document provides a detailed theoretical breakdown of the components that constitute the AI's "mind" within the SoulyCore Cognitive Architecture. It is modeled after human cognitive systems to create a more robust and intuitive framework for information processing and retrieval.

The model is divided into two main categories: **Core Memory Modules** (where information is stored) and **Cognitive Functions** (how information is processed).

### 2. Core Memory Modules

These modules represent the different types of long-term and short-term storage the AI utilizes.

| Memory Type           | Question it Answers                | Description                                                                                                        |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Working Memory**    | "What are we talking about now?"   | A high-speed, volatile "scratchpad" holding the immediate context of the current conversation (e.g., recent messages, active user goals). |
| **Episodic Memory**   | "What happened and when?"          | Stores conversations and events as sequential, time-stamped episodes. Crucial for recalling past interactions and context. |
| **Semantic Memory**   | "What is a...?"                    | A vast repository of abstract, context-free facts, concepts, and general knowledge learned from conversations.          |
| **Entity-Relation Memory** | "Who is...?" / "How is X related to Y?" | A structured database of specific entities (people, projects, companies) and the defined relationships between them. |
| **Procedural Memory** | "How do I do...?"                  | Stores knowledge about how to perform tasks, use tools, or execute multi-step workflows.                               |
| **Affective Memory**  | "How did that feel?"               | (Aspirational) Stores the emotional sentiment or tone associated with specific episodes or entities, allowing for more empathetic responses. |

### 3. Cognitive Functions

These functions are the active processes that operate on the memory modules, enabling the AI to learn, think, and respond intelligently.

#### 3.1 Attentional Filter (Pre-Processing)

This is the crucial first step when a user sends a message. The Attentional Filter analyzes the incoming query to determine what information is needed from long-term memory to form the best possible response.

*   **Purpose:** To prevent "drowning" the core AI in irrelevant data by selectively retrieving only the most pertinent context.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Analyzes the user's message to identify key concepts, named entities, and intent.
    2.  Forms targeted queries for the relevant memory modules (e.g., "Search semantic memory for 'Docker'," "Retrieve entity 'Jane Doe'").
    3.  Retrieves and ranks the results based on relevance.
    4.  Synthesizes the retrieved context into a concise block of information that is prepended to the user's original query.

#### 3.2 Consolidation & Synthesis (Post-Processing)

This is the learning process that occurs autonomously after a conversation turn is complete. It's how SoulyCore grows its knowledge base over time.

*   **Purpose:** To extract durable knowledge from ephemeral conversations and integrate it into the long-term memory modules.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Analyzes the completed exchange (user query + AI response).
    2.  Identifies new or updated entities, facts, and potential episodes.
    3.  Categorizes the extracted information.
    4.  Routes each piece of information to the appropriate memory module for storage and indexing.

#### 3.3 Strategic Forgetting

A future-state function designed to maintain the health and efficiency of the AI's memory.

*   **Purpose:** To prevent the accumulation of outdated or irrelevant information, which can degrade performance and lead to inaccurate responses.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Periodically assesses memories based on factors like frequency of access, age, and user feedback.
    2.  Identifies candidates for archiving or deletion.
    3.  Executes a pruning process to keep the knowledge base current and relevant.
